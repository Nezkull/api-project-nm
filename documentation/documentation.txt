Description
The site allows users to upload 3 thruths and a lie to the server. By clicking the Get Posts button a random submission is selected from the server and loaded into the webpage's form and selection optionas are made visible. The user is now able to guess which of the 4 statesments is a lie. Guessing correctly will change the pages background to green while an incorrect guess will change the pages background to red. The user must enter 4 statements, a name, determine which statement is a lie, and select an image (this is option as the bread is selected by default) before they are able submit the post to the server.

The API handles the submission and recieving of posts and portraying them to the webpage.

What went right is that the webpoage works pretty much exactly as I had hoped for it to work. What went wrong is that I didn't get the HEAD request setup to work and the query parameters for pulling up specific posts by name isn't setup either.

If I were to continue I would definately get the HEAD request and pulling specific posts from the server working. I would also get the restarting of the game working as well, for some reason it currently isn't working as it is supposed to.
